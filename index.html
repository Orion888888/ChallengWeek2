                <p>I was born and raised in Chicago, IL, so the diversity of food, arts, and culture has had a great impact on their life. 
                    I grew up writing and performing spoken word and poetry for several years, which led him to pursue his passion in literature. 
                    I have been teaching for 10 years working with youth from all over the city, developing curriculum, and taking on leadership roles 
                    to work with teachers on interdisciplinary work, coaching, and curriculum design. I have also coached JV and Varsity Volleyball. 
                    I love playing volleyball, exploring the arts in the city, music, food, travel, singing and writing.</p>
